# Additional stopwords

These stopwords are additional to the [NLTK English stopwords](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nltk/nltk_data/gh-pages/packages/corpora/stopwords.zip) and [USPTO stopwords](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/help/stopword.htm).
The list was created by an engineering design researcher who is familiar with patent terminology by reading 1000 randomly selected sentences after phrase detection step.
The NLTK and USPTO stopwords lists are also shared in this repository for ease of use.
