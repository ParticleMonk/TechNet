# Additional stopwords

These stopwords are additional to the NLTK English stopwords set and USPTO stopwords (http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/help/stopword.htm).
The list was created by an engineering design researcher who is familiar with patent terminology by reading 1000 randomly selected sentences after phrase detection step.
